# TAPPS Quality Pipeline

This project uses the TAPPS MCP server for code quality enforcement.
Every tool response includes `next_steps` - consider following them.
Full pipeline details are in `.claude/rules/tapps-pipeline.md` (auto-loaded for Python and infra files).

## Recommended Tool Call Obligations

You should follow these steps to avoid broken, insecure, or hallucinated code.

### Session Start

You should call `tapps_session_start()` as the first action in every session.
This returns server info (version, checkers, config) and project context.

### Before Using Any Library API

You should call `tapps_lookup_docs(library, topic)` before writing code that uses an external library.
This prevents hallucinated APIs. Prefer looking up docs over guessing from memory.

### After Editing Any Python File

You should call `tapps_quick_check(file_path)` after editing any Python file.
This runs scoring + quality gate + security scan in a single call.

### Before Declaring Work Complete

For multi-file changes: You should call `tapps_validate_changed(file_paths="file1.py,file2.py")` with explicit paths to batch-validate changed files. **Always pass `file_paths`** — auto-detect scans all git-changed files and can be very slow. Default is quick mode; only use `quick=false` as a last resort (pre-release, security audit).
Run the quality gate before considering work done.
You should call `tapps_checklist(task_type)` as the final step to verify no required tools were skipped.

### Domain Decisions

You should call `tapps_lookup_docs(library, topic)` when you need domain-specific guidance
(security patterns, testing strategy, API design, database best practices, etc.).

### Refactoring or Deleting Files

You should call `tapps_impact_analysis(file_path)` before refactoring or deleting any file.
This maps the blast radius via import graph analysis.

### Infrastructure Config Changes

You should call `tapps_validate_config(file_path)` when changing Dockerfile, docker-compose, or infra config.

## Memory System

`tapps_memory` provides persistent cross-session knowledge with **33 actions** (save, search, consolidate, federation, profiles, hive, health, and more). **Tiers:** architectural (180d), pattern (60d), procedural (30d), context (14d). **Scopes:** project, branch, session, shared. Max 1500 entries. Configure `memory_hooks` in `.tapps-mcp.yaml` for auto-recall and auto-capture.

## Quality Gate Behavior

Gate failures are sorted by category weight (highest-impact first).
A security floor of 50/100 is enforced regardless of overall score.

## Upgrade & Rollback

After upgrading TappsMCP, run `tapps_upgrade` to refresh generated files.
A timestamped backup is created before overwriting. Use `tapps-mcp rollback` to restore.
To protect customized files from upgrade, add them to `upgrade_skip_files` in `.tapps-mcp.yaml`.
