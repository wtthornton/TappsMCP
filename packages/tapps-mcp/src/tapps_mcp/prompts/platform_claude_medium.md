# TAPPS Quality Pipeline

This project uses the TAPPS MCP server for code quality enforcement.
Every tool response includes `next_steps` - consider following them.
Full pipeline details are in `.claude/rules/tapps-pipeline.md` (auto-loaded for Python and infra files).

## Tapps Rules

Seven rules every agent in this project should follow.

1. **Fix root causes, not symptoms.** No workarounds, no `--no-verify`, no try/except-and-swallow. If you are tempted to bypass a failure, stop and diagnose it.
2. **When confidence drops below 100%, query tapps-mcp before writing code.** `tapps_lookup_docs` for library APIs, `tapps_memory(action="search")` for prior decisions and patterns. Guessing from memory is the most common source of hallucinated APIs.
3. **`tapps_lookup_docs` is a Context7-backed cache — use it freely.** Lookups are local-cache-first; repeat calls are near-zero cost. There is no budget to conserve.
4. **Be context-window aware — delegate noisy work to subagents.** If a task would dump more than three file reads or large tool output you won't reference again, spawn `Explore` or `general-purpose`. Subagents return summaries; the main thread stays clean.
5. **Write clean, efficient code.** Clear names, no dead branches, no speculative abstractions, no commented-out code. Every line should justify its presence.
6. **Don't over-engineer.** The simplest solution that satisfies the requirement is the correct one. No knobs nobody asked for. Three similar lines beat a premature abstraction.
7. **Route Linear through skills, not raw plugin calls.** Use the `linear-issue` skill for any write (epic, story, update) — it runs the docs-mcp template + validator before push. Use the `linear-read` skill for multi-issue reads (cache-first). Single-issue lookups: `get_issue(id=...)` directly. Release announcements go through the `linear-release-update` skill.

## Recommended Tool Call Obligations

You should follow these steps to avoid broken, insecure, or hallucinated code.

### Session Start

You should call `tapps_session_start()` as the first action in every session.
This returns server info (version, checkers, config) and project context.

### Before Using Any Library API

You should call `tapps_lookup_docs(library, topic)` before writing code that uses an external library.
This prevents hallucinated APIs. Prefer looking up docs over guessing from memory.

### After Editing Any Python File

You should call `tapps_quick_check(file_path)` after editing any Python file.
This runs scoring + quality gate + security scan in a single call.

### Before Declaring Work Complete

For multi-file changes: You should call `tapps_validate_changed(file_paths="file1.py,file2.py")` with explicit paths to batch-validate changed files. **Always pass `file_paths`** — auto-detect scans all git-changed files and can be very slow. Default is quick mode; only use `quick=false` as a last resort (pre-release, security audit).
Run the quality gate before considering work done.
You should call `tapps_checklist(task_type)` as the final step to verify no required tools were skipped.

### Domain Decisions

You should call `tapps_lookup_docs(library, topic)` when you need domain-specific guidance
(security patterns, testing strategy, API design, database best practices, etc.).

### Refactoring or Deleting Files

You should call `tapps_impact_analysis(file_path)` before refactoring or deleting any file.
This maps the blast radius via import graph analysis.

### Infrastructure Config Changes

You should call `tapps_validate_config(file_path)` when changing Dockerfile, docker-compose, or infra config.

## Memory System

`tapps_memory` provides persistent cross-session knowledge with **33 actions** (save, search, consolidate, federation, profiles, hive, health, and more). **Tiers:** architectural (180d), pattern (60d), procedural (30d), context (14d). **Scopes:** project, branch, session, shared. Max 1500 entries. Configure `memory_hooks` in `.tapps-mcp.yaml` for auto-recall and auto-capture.

## Quality Gate Behavior

Gate failures are sorted by category weight (highest-impact first).
A security floor of 50/100 is enforced regardless of overall score.

## Upgrade & Rollback

After upgrading TappsMCP, run `tapps_upgrade` to refresh generated files.
A timestamped backup is created before overwriting. Use `tapps-mcp rollback` to restore.
To protect customized files from upgrade, add them to `upgrade_skip_files` in `.tapps-mcp.yaml`.
