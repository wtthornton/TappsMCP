# TappsMCP - instructions for AI assistants (optional guidance)

When the **TappsMCP** MCP server is configured, you can use its tools for code quality, doc lookup, and domain expert advice. The steps below are **recommended**; consider following them to avoid hallucinated APIs and missed quality steps.

**File paths:** Use paths relative to project root (e.g. `src/main.py`). Absolute host paths also work when `TAPPS_MCP_HOST_PROJECT_ROOT` is set.

## Essential tools (always-on workflow)

| Tool | When to use |
|------|--------------|
| **tapps_session_start** | **FIRST call in every session** - server info only |
| **tapps_quick_check** | **After editing any Python file** - quick score + gate + security |
| **tapps_validate_changed** | **Before declaring multi-file work complete** - score + gate on changed files |
| **tapps_checklist** | **Before declaring work complete** - reports missing required steps |
| **tapps_quality_gate** | Before declaring work complete - ensures file passes preset |

**For full tool reference** (28 tools), invoke the **tapps-tool-reference** skill when asked about tools.

## tapps_session_start vs tapps_init

| Aspect | tapps_session_start | tapps_init |
|--------|---------------------|------------|
| **When** | **First call in every session** | **Pipeline bootstrap** (once per project, or when upgrading) |
| **Duration** | Fast (~1s, server info only) | Full run: 10-35+ seconds |
| **Purpose** | Load server info (version, checkers, config) into context | Create files (AGENTS.md, TECH_STACK.md, platform rules), optionally warm cache/RAG |
| **Side effects** | None (read-only) | Writes files, warms caches |
| **Typical flow** | Call at session start, then work; call **tapps_project_profile** when you need project context | Call once to bootstrap, or `dry_run: true` to preview |

**Session start** -> `tapps_session_start`. Use this as the first call in every session. Call **tapps_project_profile** when you need project type, tech stack, or recommendations.

**Pipeline/bootstrap** -> `tapps_init`. Use when you need to set up TappsMCP in a project (AGENTS.md, TECH_STACK.md, platform rules) or upgrade existing files.

**Both in one session?** Yes. If the project is not yet bootstrapped: call `tapps_session_start` first (fast), then `tapps_init` (creates files). If the project is already bootstrapped: call only `tapps_session_start` at session start.

**Lighter tapps_init options** (for timeout-prone MCP clients): Use `dry_run: true` to preview (~2-5s); use `verify_only: true` for a quick server/checker check (~1-3s); or set `warm_cache_from_tech_stack: false` and `warm_expert_rag_from_tech_stack: false` for a faster init without cache warming.

## Domain hints for tapps_consult_expert

Pass the `domain` parameter when the context clearly implies a domain. This improves routing accuracy and avoids auto-detection mistakes.

| Context | domain value |
|---------|--------------|
| Editing test files, conftest.py, pytest config | `testing-strategies` |
| Security-sensitive code, auth, validation | `security` |
| API routes, FastAPI/Flask endpoints | `api-design-integration` |
| Database models, migrations, queries | `database-data-management` |
| Dockerfile, docker-compose, k8s manifests | `cloud-infrastructure` |
| CI/CD, workflows, build config | `development-workflow` |
| Code quality, linting, type hints | `code-quality-analysis` |
| Architecture decisions, patterns | `software-architecture` |

When in doubt, omit `domain` to let auto-detection from the question text choose.

---

## Optional workflow (consider when useful)

1. **Session start:** Consider calling `tapps_session_start` for server info. Call `tapps_project_profile` when you need project context. Optionally call `tapps_list_experts` if you may need experts.
2. **Record key decisions:** Optionally use `tapps_session_notes(action="save", ...)` for session-local notes. Use `tapps_memory(action="save", ...)` to persist findings across sessions.
3. **Before using a library:** Consider calling `tapps_lookup_docs(library=...)` to avoid hallucinated APIs.
4. **Before modifying a file's API:** Consider `tapps_impact_analysis(file_path=...)` to see what depends on it.
5. **During edits:** Consider `tapps_quick_check(file_path=...)` or `tapps_score_file(file_path=..., quick=True)` after Python file edits.
6. **Before declaring work complete:** Consider calling `tapps_validate_changed()` and `tapps_checklist(task_type=...)` to verify quality. Use `tapps_report(format="markdown")` if the user wants a summary.
7. **When in doubt:** Consider `tapps_consult_expert` for domain questions and `tapps_validate_config` for Docker/infra files.

### Review Pipeline (multi-file)

For reviewing and fixing multiple files in parallel, use the `/tapps-review-pipeline` skill:

1. It detects changed Python files and spawns `tapps-review-fixer` agents (one per file or batch)
2. Each agent scores the file, fixes issues, and runs the quality gate
3. Results are merged and validated with `tapps_validate_changed`
4. A summary table shows before/after scores, gate status, and fixes applied

You can also invoke the `tapps-review-fixer` agent directly on individual files for combined review+fix in a single pass.

## Checklist task types

Use the `task_type` that best matches the current work:

- **feature** - New code
- **bugfix** - Fixing a bug
- **refactor** - Refactoring
- **security** - Security-focused change
- **review** - General code review (default)

The checklist uses this to decide which tools are required vs recommended vs optional for that task.

## Memory systems

Your project may have two complementary memory systems. Use the right one for each type of knowledge:

- **Claude Code auto memory** (`~/.claude/projects/<project>/memory/MEMORY.md`): Session learnings, user preferences, build commands, IDE settings, debugging insights. Auto-managed by Claude Code across sessions.
- **TappsMCP shared memory** (`tapps_memory` tool): Architecture decisions, quality patterns, expert consultation findings, cross-agent knowledge. Structured with tier classification (architectural/pattern/context), confidence scoring, decay, contradiction detection, and cross-session persistence.

**When to use which:**
- Build commands, IDE preferences, personal workflow notes --> auto memory
- Architecture decisions, quality patterns, cross-agent knowledge --> `tapps_memory`

Consider using `tapps_memory` for important architecture decisions.

## Platform hooks and automation

When `tapps_init` generates platform-specific files, it also creates **hooks**, **subagents**, and **skills** that automate parts of the workflow:

### Hooks (auto-generated)

**Claude Code** (`.claude/hooks/`): 7 hook scripts that enforce quality automatically:
- **SessionStart** - Injects TappsMCP awareness on session start and after compaction
- **PostToolUse (Edit/Write)** - Reminds you to run `tapps_quick_check` after Python edits
- **Stop** - Reminds you to run `tapps_validate_changed` before session end (non-blocking)
- **TaskCompleted** - Reminds you to validate before marking task complete (non-blocking)
- **PreCompact** - Backs up scoring context before context window compaction
- **SubagentStart** - Injects TappsMCP awareness into spawned subagents

**Cursor** (`.cursor/hooks/`): 3 hook scripts:
- **beforeMCPExecution** - Logs MCP tool invocations for observability
- **afterFileEdit** - Fire-and-forget reminder to run quality checks
- **stop** - Prompts validation via followup_message before session ends

### Subagents (auto-generated)

Three agent definitions per platform in `.claude/agents/` or `.cursor/agents/`:
- **tapps-reviewer** (sonnet) - Reviews code quality and runs security scans after edits
- **tapps-researcher** (haiku) - Looks up documentation and consults domain experts
- **tapps-validator** (sonnet) - Runs pre-completion validation on all changed files

### Skills (auto-generated)

Seven SKILL.md files per platform in `.claude/skills/` or `.cursor/skills/`:
- **tapps-score** - Score a Python file across 7 quality categories
- **tapps-gate** - Run a quality gate check and report pass/fail
- **tapps-validate** - Validate all changed files before declaring work complete
- **tapps-review-pipeline** - Orchestrate a parallel review-fix-validate pipeline
- **tapps-research** - Research a technical question using domain experts and docs
- **tapps-security** - Run a comprehensive security audit with vulnerability scanning
- **tapps-memory** - Manage shared project memory for cross-session knowledge

### Agent Teams (opt-in, Claude Code only)

When `tapps_init` is called with `agent_teams=True`, additional hooks enable a quality watchdog teammate pattern:
- **TeammateIdle** - Keeps the quality watchdog active while issues remain
- **TaskCompleted** - Reminds about quality gate validation on task completion

Set `CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS=1` to enable Agent Teams.

### VS Code / Copilot Instructions (auto-generated)

`.github/copilot-instructions.md` - Provides GitHub Copilot in VS Code with
TappsMCP tool guidance, recommended workflow, and scoring category reference.

### Cursor BugBot Rules (auto-generated, Cursor only)

`.cursor/BUGBOT.md` - Quality standards for Cursor BugBot automated PR review:
security requirements, style rules, testing requirements, and scoring thresholds.

### CI Integration (auto-generated)

`.github/workflows/tapps-quality.yml` - GitHub Actions workflow that validates
changed Python files on every pull request using TappsMCP quality gates.

### MCP Elicitation

When the MCP client supports elicitation (e.g. Cursor), TappsMCP can prompt
the user interactively:
- `tapps_quality_gate` prompts for preset selection when none is provided
- `tapps_init` asks for confirmation before writing configuration files

On unsupported clients, tools fall back to default behavior silently.

## Troubleshooting: MCP tool permissions

If TappsMCP tools are being rejected or prompting for approval on every call:

**Claude Code:** Ensure `.claude/settings.json` contains **both** permission entries:
```json
{
  "permissions": {
    "allow": [
      "mcp__tapps-mcp",
      "mcp__tapps-mcp__*"
    ]
  }
}
```
The bare `mcp__tapps-mcp` entry is needed as a reliable fallback - the wildcard `mcp__tapps-mcp__*` syntax has known issues in some Claude Code versions (see issues #3107, #13077, #27139). Run `tapps-mcp upgrade --host claude-code` to fix automatically.

**Cursor / VS Code:** These hosts manage MCP tool permissions differently. No `.claude/settings.json` needed.

**If tools are still rejected after fixing permissions:**
1. Restart your MCP host (Claude Code / Cursor / VS Code)
2. Verify the TappsMCP server is running: `tapps-mcp doctor`
3. Check that your permission mode is not `dontAsk` (which auto-denies unlisted tools)
4. As a last resort, use `tapps_quick_check` on individual files instead of `tapps_validate_changed`
