# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Changed (Performance - 2026-02-23)

- **tapps_validate_changed parallel file processing** - files are now scored concurrently via `asyncio.gather` with a semaphore (max 5 concurrent), replacing the sequential loop. Expected ~4-5x speedup on multi-file changesets.
- **tapps_validate_changed bandit deduplication** - eliminated redundant `run_security_scan()` call that re-ran bandit per file. Bandit results from `scorer.score_file()` are now reused; only `SecretScanner` runs separately for secret detection.

### Added (Init/Upgrade/Permissions - 2026-02-23)

- **`tapps-mcp upgrade` CLI command** - validates and updates all generated files (AGENTS.md, platform rules, hooks, agents, skills, `.claude/settings.json`) after upgrading TappsMCP.
- **Dual permission entries** - `_bootstrap_claude_settings()` now adds both `mcp__tapps-mcp` (bare server match, reliable) and `mcp__tapps-mcp__*` (wildcard, Claude Code 2.0.70+) to work around known Claude Code permission bugs (#3107, #13077, #27139).
- **AGENTS.md troubleshooting section** - new "Troubleshooting: MCP tool permissions" section with permission fix instructions and fallback guidance.
- **Doctor checks** - `check_agents_md()`, `check_claude_settings()` (validates both permission entries), `check_hooks()` for comprehensive diagnostics.
- **Tool fallback guidance** - `tapps_validate_changed` and `tapps_quality_gate` docstrings now include fallback instructions when the tool is rejected.
- **AGENTS.md smart-merge** - `_bootstrap_claude()` overwrite bug fixed (was duplicating TAPPS content instead of replacing).
- **Template version injection** - `load_agents_template()` dynamically prepends version marker instead of hardcoding.

### Changed (Init/Upgrade/Permissions - 2026-02-23)

- EXPECTED_TOOLS updated from 17 to 21 (added `tapps_session_start`, `tapps_quick_check`, `tapps_validate_changed`, `tapps_research`).
- EXPECTED_SECTIONS updated from 5 to 8 (added `tapps_session_start vs tapps_init`, `Platform hooks and automation`, `Troubleshooting: MCP tool permissions`).
- agents_template.md rewritten to match production AGENTS.md (99 lines to 217 lines).
- Platform rules (platform_claude.md, platform_cursor.md) now reference `tapps_workflow` MCP prompt correctly.
- Handoff and runlog templates updated with `tapps_session_start` and `tapps_validate_changed`.

### Removed (Documentation Cleanup - 2026-02-23)

- Deleted 7 completed planning/task docs from `docs/`: CLARITY_RECOMMENDATIONS.md, COVERAGE_METRICS_IMPLEMENTATION_TASK.md, FEEDBACK_ISSUES_PLAN.md, REVIEW_TRACKING.md, CRITICAL_HIGH_REVIEW_PLAN.md, IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN_CRITICAL_HIGH_MEDIUM.md, SELF_REVIEW_FINDINGS.md.
- Deleted 18 completed Epic 12 story files from `docs/planning/epics/EPIC-12-PLATFORM-INTEGRATION/stories/` (research/ and README retained for architectural context).

### Added (Implementation Plan Execution - 2026-02-22)

- **Docker Compose explicit networks** — `docker-compose.yml` now defines `tapps-network` and assigns the `tapps-mcp` service to it.
- **Expert RAG relevance threshold** — `SimpleKnowledgeBase` and `VectorKnowledgeBase` filter chunks below `relevance_threshold` (default 0.2/0.3); reduces irrelevant expert consultation results.
- **MCP-specific knowledge** — New `testing/mcp-testing-patterns.md` and `software-architecture/mcp-server-architecture.md` for improved RAG relevance on MCP architecture/testing questions.
- **tapps_lookup_docs expert fallback** — When Context7 and cache fail, returns expert knowledge base content as `expert_fallback` so users get useful guidance without API key.
- **tapps_lookup_docs error improvement** — No-API-key error now suggests `tapps_init` with `warm_cache_from_tech_stack=True` as alternative.
- **tapps_report max_files and parallel scoring** — New `max_files` parameter (default 20); project-wide report uses `asyncio.gather` for parallel file scoring.

### Changed (Implementation Plan Execution — 2026-02-22)

- **adaptive/persistence.py** — Extracted `_parse_consultation_line` and `_passes_consultation_filter`; reduced cyclomatic complexity.
- **adaptive/voting_engine.py** — Extracted `_normalize_domain_column` and `_enforce_primary_floor`; simplified `_normalize_matrix`.
- **Adaptive min_outcomes** — Lowered from 10 to 5 so adaptive weights activate sooner (scoring_engine, settings, default.yaml).
- **bootstrap_pipeline** — Accepts optional `config: BootstrapConfig` to reduce parameter branching; kwargs still supported.

### Added (Critical/High Review — 2026-02-22)

- **Checklist persistence** — `CallTracker` now persists call records to `.tapps-mcp/sessions/checklist_calls.jsonl`; `set_persist_path` is invoked on first tool call so state survives server restarts.
- **Expert RAG error surfacing** — `tapps_init` appends expert RAG `failed_domains` to `errors` so `success` reflects subsystem failure.
- **Dry-run for init** — `tapps_init` (MCP tool) and `tapps-mcp init` (CLI) support `dry_run` / `--dry-run` to preview what would be created without writing.
- **Feedback → AdaptiveScoringEngine** — `AdaptiveScoringEngine` accepts optional `metrics_dir`; when provided, feedback records from `tapps_feedback` are merged so negative feedback influences weight recalibration.

### Added (Epic 12: Platform Integration — Tiers 1-4, Complete)

- **Claude Code hooks generation** — 7 hook scripts in `.claude/hooks/`: session start, session compact, post-edit, stop (exit 2 blocks until validated), task-completed (exit 2 blocks premature completion), pre-compact (context backup), subagent-start. Deep-merges into `.claude/settings.json` preserving existing entries.
- **Cursor hooks generation** — 3 hook scripts in `.cursor/hooks/`: before-MCP-execution (logging), after-file-edit (fire-and-forget reminder), stop (followup_message JSON). Merges into `.cursor/hooks.json`.
- **Subagent definitions** — 3 agents per platform (tapps-reviewer, tapps-researcher, tapps-validator) with platform-specific frontmatter: Claude Code uses comma-separated tools/permissionMode/memory; Cursor uses YAML array tools/readonly.
- **Skills generation** — 3 SKILL.md files per platform (tapps-score, tapps-gate, tapps-validate) with platform-specific tool references: Claude Code uses `mcp__tapps-mcp__` prefixed names; Cursor uses short names.
- **Cursor rule types** — 3 distinct `.mdc` rule files: `tapps-pipeline.mdc` (alwaysApply), `tapps-python-quality.mdc` (autoAttach via `globs: "*.py"`), `tapps-expert-consultation.mdc` (agentRequested via description). Reduces context bloat by targeting rules to relevant moments.
- **Claude Code plugin bundle** — `generate_claude_plugin_bundle()` creates complete plugin directory with `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`, agents, skills, hooks, `.mcp.json`, README.
- **Cursor plugin bundle** — `generate_cursor_plugin_bundle()` creates complete plugin directory with `.cursor-plugin/plugin.json` (7 required fields), agents, skills, hooks, rules, `mcp.json`, logo.png, README, LICENSE.
- **Agent Teams integration** — Optional `agent_teams=True` flag on `tapps_init` generates TeammateIdle and TaskCompleted hooks for quality watchdog teammate pattern. CLAUDE.md template now documents `CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS` workflow.
- **New module `pipeline/platform_generators.py`** — Centralizes all platform artifact generation (hooks, agents, skills, rules, plugins) separate from `init.py`. Used by both `tapps_init` (MCP tool) and `tapps-mcp init` (CLI).
- **VS Code / Copilot instructions** — `generate_copilot_instructions()` creates `.github/copilot-instructions.md` with TappsMCP tool guidance, workflow steps, and scoring categories for GitHub Copilot in VS Code.
- **Cursor BugBot rules** — `generate_bugbot_rules()` creates `.cursor/BUGBOT.md` with quality standards, security requirements, style rules, and testing requirements for automated PR review.
- **MCP elicitation support** — `tapps_quality_gate` and `tapps_init` now accept an optional MCP `Context` parameter. When `preset` is empty, quality gate prompts the user via elicitation; `tapps_init` asks for confirmation before writing files. Gracefully degrades on unsupported clients.
- **CI/Headless documentation** — `generate_ci_workflow()` creates `.github/workflows/tapps-quality.yml` GitHub Actions workflow. CLAUDE.md template now includes CI Integration section covering headless mode, `--init-only`, and `enableAllProjectMcpServers`.
- **Cursor marketplace plugin** — Complete `plugin/cursor/` directory with `marketplace.json`, `.cursor-plugin/plugin.json`, skills, agents, hooks, rules, mcp.json, logo, CHANGELOG, README with install deep link.
- **Agent SDK examples** — `examples/agent-sdk/` with Python and TypeScript examples for basic quality check, CI pipeline, and subagent registration via Claude Agent SDK.
- **Validation script** — `scripts/validate-cursor-plugin.sh` for CI validation of Cursor plugin manifest and required files.

**Upgrade path for consuming projects:** After upgrading TappsMCP, run `tapps_init` with `platform="claude"` (or `"cursor"`) and `overwrite_platform_rules=True` to generate hooks, agents, skills, and enhanced rules. Use `agent_teams=True` for Agent Teams support.

## [0.2.1] - 2026-02-21

### Added (Epic 10: Expert + Context7 Integration)

- **Expert + doc lookup coupling** — Workflow guidance for combining `tapps_consult_expert` with `tapps_lookup_docs` for testing/library questions (AGENTS.md, recommended_workflow)
- **Structured hints when RAG is empty** — `suggested_tool`, `suggested_library`, `suggested_topic` in `tapps_consult_expert` response for machine-parseable follow-up
- **Auto-fallback to Context7** — When expert RAG returns no chunks, automatically calls lookup_docs and merges content (configurable via `expert_auto_fallback` and `expert_fallback_max_chars` settings)
- **Broader testing-strategies KB** — Knowledge on test config, base URLs, env vars, fixtures, monkeypatch (`test-configuration-and-urls.md`)
- **`tapps_research` tool** — Single tool combining expert consultation + Context7 documentation in one call

### Added (Epic 11: Retrieval Optimization)

- **Hybrid fusion + rerank** — `VectorKnowledgeBase._hybrid_fuse()` combines vector and keyword results with weighted scoring and structural bonus
- **Hot-rank adaptive ranking** — `compute_hot_rank()` uses recency decay, helpfulness, confidence trend, and exploration bonus to prioritize domains
- **Fuzzy matcher v2** — Multi-signal matching (LCS + edit distance + token overlap + alias + prefix + confidence bands + "did you mean" + manifest priors)
- **Context7 code-reference normalization** — Snippet extraction, ranking, deduplication, reference cards, and token budgets (`content_normalizer.py`)
- **Retrieval evaluation harness** — 10 benchmark queries across 8 domains with quality gates (pass rate, latency, keyword coverage)

**Upgrade path for consuming projects:** After upgrading TappsMCP, run `tapps_init` with `overwrite_agents_md=True` and `overwrite_platform_rules=True` to refresh AGENTS.md and pipeline rules. See [docs/INIT_AND_UPGRADE_FEATURE_LIST.md](docs/INIT_AND_UPGRADE_FEATURE_LIST.md).
